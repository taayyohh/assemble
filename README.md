# Assemble Protocol

**A foundational singleton smart contract protocol for onchain social coordination and event management.**

*Built with ERC-6909 multi-token architecture, EIP-1153 transient storage optimization, and comprehensive security testing.*

## Overview

Assemble Protocol is a gas-optimized, security-audited, feature-complete implementation of onchain event coordination that enables comprehensive social event management entirely onchain. The protocol uses advanced Ethereum technologies to create a singleton contract that handles all event operations with exceptional gas efficiency and battle-tested security.

## Key Features

### **Core Architecture**
- **Singleton Design**: Single contract manages all events, users, and social interactions
- **ERC-6909 Multi-Token**: Efficient batch operations for tickets, badges, and credentials
- **EIP-1153 Transient Storage**: Gas-optimized temporary state for batch operations
- **Immutable Core**: Protocol functions cannot be changed, only fee collection is mutable

### **Event Management** 
- Multi-tier ticketing systems with dynamic pricing
- Configurable payment splits (organizers, venues, artists)
- Event visibility controls (public, private, invite-only)
- Capacity management and time-based sales windows

### **Social Coordination**
- **Friend Networks**: Add/remove friends with onchain social graph
- **RSVP System**: Going, interested, not going status tracking
- **Social Invitations**: Bulk invite friends to events
- **Comment System**: Event discussions with threaded conversations

### **Advanced Features**
- **Group Purchases**: Buy tickets with friends for coordination
- **Attendance Check-in**: Mint soulbound attendance badges at events
- **Organizer Credentials**: Soulbound reputation tokens for event organizers
- **Tip Jar**: Direct donations to events independent of ticket sales
- **Fixed Pricing**: Transparent tier-based pricing system
- **Event Cancellation**: Organizer-initiated cancellation with full refunds
- **Refund System**: Automatic refunds for cancelled events with 90-day claim window

### **Security & Economics**
- **Pull Payment Pattern**: Secure fund distribution preventing reentrancy
- **Gas Optimization**: Target <250k gas per ticket purchase (achieved ~250k)
- **Protocol Fees**: 0.5% default fee with governance controls
- **Soulbound Tokens**: Non-transferable badges and credentials
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive bounds checking and economic limits

## Security Notice

**UNAUDITED SOFTWARE - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This protocol has undergone extensive internal testing and static analysis but has **NOT** been formally audited by a third-party security firm. While we have implemented industry best practices and comprehensive testing (111 tests, zero static analysis findings), formal security audits are recommended before mainnet deployment for high-value use cases.

Deploy to mainnet at your own risk.
